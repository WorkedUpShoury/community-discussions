## 🧭 1. **Internship/Opportunity Aggregators**

### 🔹 Examples:

- [Internshala](https://internshala.com/)
    
- [LetsIntern](https://www.letsintern.com/)
    
- [HelloIntern](https://www.hellointern.com/)
    
- [LinkedIn Jobs](https://linkedin.com/jobs)
    

#### ✅ What they do well:

- Job-style listings with filters by field, location, duration
    
- Some offer training programs or resume tools
    

#### 🔧 What’s lacking:

- Overwhelming for beginners (too many filters or irrelevant results)
    
- Heavily focused on **jobs**, less on **hackathons, camps, certifications**
    
- Requires account creation/login early
    
- Some are spammy or have outdated listings
    

#### 🌱 Fresher404 angle:

- Focus only on **curated platforms**, not job listings
    
- Beginner-friendly UI: zero clutter, no login
    
- Includes **non-internship growth paths** like camps, competitions, hackathons

- [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
    
- [MLH.io](https://mlh.io/)
    

#### ✅ What they do well:

- Well-structured hackathon listings
    
- Filtering by region/date/theme
    
- Developer/tech community involvement
    

#### 🔧 What’s lacking:

- Tech-centric; not for general fields (design, business, etc.)
    
- Focus on **events**, not **learning resources**
    
- Not beginner-centric — can feel intimidating
    

#### 🌱 Fresher404 edge:

- Include **multi-domain competitions** (design, writing, entrepreneurship)

#### 🌱 Fresher404 improvement:

#### 🌱 Fresher404’s advantage:

- A cleaner, more visual, modern design
    
- Narrowed focus just for **freshers** (not grad school applicants or professionals)
    
- Clear filters, UX, mobile-first
