## 🎯 **Project Pitch: Fresher404**

### 📛 Project Name:

**Fresher404**

---

### 🔍 Tagline:

**"Helping freshers find their path — curated opportunities, one link at a time."**

---

### 🧠 Problem:

Freshers and college students often get **lost in the noise** of the internet while looking for:

- **Internships**
    
- **Certifications**
    
- **Hackathons**
    
- **Competitions**
    
- **Camps & Student Programs**
    

Most existing platforms are either **too broad**, filled with **irrelevant or outdated content**, or require paid access. Beginners don’t know **where to start**, and there's no single space that **trusts, curates, and organizes** these resources.

---

### 💡 Solution:

**Fresher404** is a **curated web directory** made specifically for students and fresh graduates. It helps them discover **legit, accessible, and up-to-date** platforms and resources — without overwhelming them.

It’s like the **“resource map” every fresher wishes they had** when starting out.
