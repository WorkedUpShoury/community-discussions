## üß≠ 1. **Understand the Project Goals**

Before any design:

- **Purpose**: What is the site for (e.g. portfolio, e-commerce, SaaS)?
    
- **Target audience**: Who are you designing for?
    
- **Client expectations**: Any moodboards, references, or non-negotiables?
    

---

## üìö 2. **Research & Discovery**

- **Competitor analysis**: What are similar sites doing? What can be improved?
    
- **User research**: (If possible) Get real input from the target audience.
    
- **Brand audit**: Does the client already have a brand? If yes, understand its assets and tone.

## üé® 3. **Branding Essentials**

Frame the **visual identity**:

- **Logo** (existing or design one)
    
- **Color palette**: Choose 2‚Äì3 primaries and supporting neutrals/accent colors.
    
- **Typography**: Pair fonts for headings, body, and UI text.
    
- **Imagery style**: Photography, illustration, 3D? What kind of visuals fit the brand?
    
- **Voice & tone** (if you're involved in content direction): Formal, casual, friendly?
    

Deliverable: **Brand Style Guide** (even if lightweight)

## üß± 4. **Site Structure (Information Architecture)**

This is about how the content and pages are organized:

- Create a **site map**: Map out the main navigation and subpages (e.g. Home, About, Services, Blog, Contact).
    
- Think about **user flow**: How will a user move through the site to accomplish their goals?
    
- Start thinking in **components**: headers, footers, cards, CTAs, sections, etc.
    

Deliverable: **Site Map** + **User Flow Diagrams**

## üñçÔ∏è 5. **Wireframing**

Low-fidelity to high-fidelity:

- Start with **lo-fi wireframes** (boxes, grayscale layouts to focus on layout)
    
- Progress to **hi-fi wireframes or mockups** in your design tool (Figma, Adobe XD, etc.)
    

Key screens to wireframe first:

- Homepage
    
- Key conversion page (e.g. product, contact, portfolio)
    
- Navigation & footer
    
- Mobile versions!

## üìê 6. **Design System**

Even if basic, set a reusable system:

- Buttons (states)
    
- Forms (inputs, errors)
    
- Icons
    
- Layout grids & spacing
    
- Components like cards, modals, etc.
    

Deliverable: **Mini Design System or Component Library**

## üì± 7. **Responsive Design**

Design for:

- Desktop
    
- Tablet
    
- Mobile
    

Keep usability and layout flexibility in mind.

## üõ†Ô∏è 8. **Developer Handoff / Collaboration**

If you‚Äôre not coding, make sure to:

- Use a tool like **Figma** with **dev mode** enabled
    
- Name layers clearly
    
- Provide design specs (font sizes, paddings, colors)
    
- Export assets (SVGs, images) if needed

## Optional but Strong Enhancers

- **Accessibility**: Design with A11y in mind (contrast, keyboard navigation)
    
- **Animation planning**: What should animate on scroll, hover, etc.?
    
- **Content placeholders**: Suggest where headlines, text, images, or calls to action should go
